# If you want to remove the file from the Git repository and the filesystem, use:

    git rm file1.txt
    git commit -m "remove file1.txt"

# But if you want to remove the file only from the Git repository and not remove it from the filesystem, use:

    git rm --cached file1.txt
    git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
    And to push changes to remote repo

    git push origin branch_name


# First, it's always worth noting that git reset --hard is a potentially dangerous command, since it throws away all your uncommitted changes.

# I know that Git tracks changes I make to my application, and holds on to them until I commit the changes.

# To revert to a previous commit, I used:

    git reset --hard HEAD

    HEAD is now at 820f417 micro

    git log
    git reset --hard 1db601572ec269a0fb4e9545b01e6dc857cc032e 
    git pull origin branch_name
    git push origin branch_name


# reset is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous commit, discarding any changes made after that commit

    git restore --staged example.txt
    git reset  (at time all untracked files)
