DevOps Automation with ChatGPT

1) Write a Dockerfile for nodejs application.
2) Explain exactly what WORKDIR directive means in dockerfile.
3) Use yarn instead of dockerfile.
4) now only copy relevant application files, not everything to the app image.
5) use multi-stage build
6) adjust the multi-stage build to use yarn, exclude app files from dockerignore file when copying them into docker image and provide docker command example with a specific iamge tag of 1.0
7) create a k8s deployment manifest file for ths docker images
8) adjust deployment manifest with production adn security best practices
9) is seems like some best practices are missing.so please adjust deployment file 
properly with production and security best practices, without explanation, just provide the example manifest file
10) on top of those new configuration options, also add securityContext configuration in the deployment file
11) now write a jenkinfile for the complete CI/CD pipeline for the above nodejs application, including deployment to k8s cluster
12) now adjust the jenkinfile to have 1 stage for building and pushing the docker image and  logging in to the dockerHub private repository
in the final stage, apply deployment and service files to the k8s cluster, but keep the KUBE_CONFIG parameter
13) keep the build and test stages as they were initially, but create a separate stage for building a docker image and pushing to docker repository, but before pushing image, make sure to log in to the docker repository first.
14 ) add deploy to kubernetes stage as in the previous example. also read the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAEM as a credential, just like the DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD, but 
call then DOCKER_USER and DOCKER_PWD respectively and also use the credentials function instead of withCredentials to read both of these values.
15) add a stage to notify team through slack channel about the build status
16 ) slack notification should be sent either for failure ro success and should always execute after the build is finished as the last step
17) continue with your response
18) give me a Gitlab CI equivalent of this Jenkinfile:
